Hello World!!!! 

(^_^)

******************************************************************************************

My name is Angelica, I've been working with computers for over 2 decades. I started coding when I was just 12 years old by creating web pages in HTML. I am fairly versed in both HTML & CSS and have dabbled in PHP. I've always incorporated JavaScript in my sites, but I never actually wrote any of my own scripts... just modified those written by others. 

Last year I made the decision to turn my life-long love of computers into a career. I have started my own consulting & repair business: ESO Computing. In doing so, I've realized that I want to acheive a dream I had as a child: I want to be a software engineer. Ideally, I'd like to work in web development. I've decided to begin learning various programming languages, beginning with JavaScript. 

I look forward to learning & contributing!!!
